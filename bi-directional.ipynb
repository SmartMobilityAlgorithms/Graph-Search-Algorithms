    "This route doesn't seem to be right? in the middle of the route there is something irregular in the direction of the \"ants\" that is because when two nodes from source and target expansion collided and each of them is originating from different origin so you need to reverse the route of one of them so you could have one way route directly from source to destination. After this reversing one of the routes, that route breaks because it is not always the case that there is an edge from $A$ to $B$ and edge from $B$ to $A$ so we need a new route between $B$ and the node after $A$ instead of $A$ so we could have feasible route in our map.\n",

    "### About the algorithm\n",
    "* As you can see we alternate between expansion from the front frontier and back frontier until the two frontiers collide at the middle and then stitch the two routes of the colliding nodes and voila you get your route.\n",
    "* This alternation is one way to implement bi-directional, but here is another one where the **alternation** between front expansion and back expansion based on a heuristic not turn by turn.\n",
    "* The heuristic will compute a value for the node to be expanded from the front and the node to be expanded from the back and choose which one to expand.\n",
    "* As example you can check the length of edge between the parent node and the node to be expanded at the two frontiers, and choose the frontier that makes you take the edge with the minimum length -- this is how bi-directional dijkstra is usually implemented in literature and once you choose a certain frontier you expand and relax and implement the typical dijkstra algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the implementation\n",
    "* The graph is multi-digraph as you probably know, so we can have an edge from \"a\" to \"b\" but not from \"b\" to \"a\", in other words; one way street or two way street.  \n",
    "* When the collusion happens between front expansion and expanded nodes at the back, we get a route from source to the node and a route from destination to the node and then reverse that route from destination to the route, to have a single route from source to destination.\n",
    "* When we reverse the destination route, we have no idea of edges between this new sequence of nodes whould have edge when reversed, but we are sure they have an edge in the other direction -- one way and two way streets.\n",
    "* We handle that by try the original sequence in the route list, if two consecutive nodes produced an exception they we reverse them and get the edge in the other direction -- which maybe another edge completely.\n",
    "* That is why the ant path changes its direction at the middle of the route.  \n",
    "* This can be solved by check the validity of the reversed route and discard the route if there is only a one street way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we have and edge from 24960080 to 3707407641 but we don't have an edge from 3707407641 to 24960080.\n",
    "That is why we don't use [`ox.plot_graph_route`](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/osmnx.html#osmnx.plot.plot_graph_route) because it can't handle this situation\n",
    "\n",
    "So the above algorithm may fail on some instances but the fix is very easy but super ugly and would destruct the \"clearity\" of the code so we skipped it, but here is what you want to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After collusion check the validity of the reversed route\n",
    "2. If it is invalid, delete the node that caused the collusion from the graph and proceed to the next iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "OR\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix that route by deleting the node from the route that caused the discontinuity and find the shortest path that would replace that gap between the node before and the node after using `shortest_path_with_failed_nodes`, so the final route would be approximation for the actual search result but pretty good AND correct approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So as you can see the algorithms for SP are very easy and intuitive, but you need to deal with a lot of corner cases to deal with multigraphs.\n",
